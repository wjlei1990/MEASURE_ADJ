#This program is used to select window(FLEXWIN), make measurements and calculate adjoint source. There are so many people who contributed to FLEXWIN and Measure_adj. I will add credit soon...

#ASDF Version DEVELOPER: Wenjie Leio
#ORIGINAL DEVELOPER: Qinya Liu, Carl Tape, Ying Zhou

#----------------------------------
Pre-request:
1) ADIOS-1.5.0
2) SAC

#----------------------------------
How to run the example:
1) copy test PAR_FILE
    cp PAR_FILE_MAIN.test PAR_FILE_MAIN
2) compile the code
    make clean; make
3) run the code
    ./Measure_adj

#----------------------------------
How to run:
1 There are at least several Par_file you might be intrested in:
  a) PAR_FILE_MAIN: flags and file info
  b) measure_adj/PAR_FILES: includes the previous MEASUREMENT.PAR file(also differentiated by component and period band). You don't need the MEASUREMENT.WINDOWS file now since this kind of information is in the memory now.

2. make clean; make

3. ./Measure_adj(you can also submit the job the cluster and run it in parallel, which is the ultimate point of this program. But even you run on 1 processor, you can still get hugh speed up!)


#----------------------------------
TODO:
1) Give options to weighting.
2) Modify Makefile

#This program is used to select window(FLEXWIN), make measurements and calculate adjoint source. There are so many people who contributed to FLEXWIN and Measure_adj. I will add credit soon...

#PARALLEL DEVELOPER: Wenjie Leio
#ORIGINAL DEVELOPER: add soon...

How to run:
1 There are at least several Par_file you might be intrested in:
  a) PAR_FILE_MAIN: flags and file info
  b) FLEXWIN/PAR_FILES: Parameter files for flexwin, differetiated by component and period band.
  c) FLEXWIN/src/user_functions.f90: user_functions settings inside. Modify it a little. However, if you look into it, it's very simple. Have to make this modification because we are now working in a different way.
  d) measure_adj/PAR_FILES: includes the previous MEASUREMENT.PAR file(also differentiated by component and period band). You don't need the MEASUREMENT.WINDOWS file now since this kind of information is in the memory now.

2. make clean --> make

3. ./TEST(you can also submit the job the cluster and run it in parallel, which is the ultimate point of this program. But even you run on 1 processor, you can still get hugh speed up!)


TODO:
1) Give options to weighting.
2) The code works but far from perfect. Still need time the check carefully.
3) still a lot improvements. The 1st released version is simplied whatever.
